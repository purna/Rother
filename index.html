<h3>PLAY FAIR… ALWAYS!</h3>
<p>Remember the saying, "Actions speak louder than words"? That's especially true when it comes to teaching kids the basics of good sportsmanship. Your behaviour during practices and games will influence them more than any pep talk or lecture you give them. 
Here are some suggestions on how to build sportsmanship in your child:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unless you're coaching your child's team, you need to remember that you're the parent.  Only shout words of encouragement, not directions, from the sidelines (there is a difference!). </li>
<li>If you are your kid's coach, don't expect too much out of your own child.  Don't be harder on him or her than on anyone else in the team, but don't play favourites either. </li>
<li>Keep your comments positive. Don't bad-mouth coaches, players, or other officials. If you have a serious concern about the way that games or practices are being conducted, or if you're upset about other parents' behaviour, discuss it privately with your child's coach or with a league official.</li> 
<li>When you're talking to your child after a competition, it's important not to dwell on who won or lost.  Instead, you might ask your child, "How did you feel you did during the game?"  If your child mentions that he or she didn't do well at a particular skill, like shooting or passing, offer to work on these skills with your child before the next game. </li>
<li>Applaud good play no matter who does it. </li>
<li>Set a good example with your courteous behaviour toward the parents of kids on the other team. Congratulate them when their kids win. </li>
<li>Remember that it's your child, not you, who is playing. Don't push your child into a sport because it's what you enjoyed. As your child gets older, let your child choose the sport he or she wants to play, and let him or her decide the level of commitment they want to make to it.</li> 
<li>Keep your perspective. It's just a game. Even if your child's team loses every game of the season it's unlikely to ruin his or her life or chances of success. </li>
<li>Look for examples of good sportsmanship in professional athletes and point them out to your kid. Talk about the bad examples, too, and why they upset you. </li>
<li>Finally, don't forget to have fun! Even if your child isn't the star, enjoy the game while you're thinking of all the benefits your child is gaining - new skills, new friends, and positive attitudes that can help him or her all through life.</li>

<h3>2018 Cup Finals</h3>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to recognise and thank everyone connected with Bexhill United FC for providing the facilities for our cup final. I’m sure that the surroundings, together with the support of the crowd, will lead to all the players having a day to remember and treasure. After all, that is really all that matters.</p>
<p>I’d also like to give my wholehearted congratulations to all the teams getting to the final. </p>
<p>Cup football, at all levels of the game, is often more exciting simply because of the ‘sudden death’ element. A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</p>
<p>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</p>
<p>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</p>
<p>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all of this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.</p>
